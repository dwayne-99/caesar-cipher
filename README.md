# caesar cipher
 
This code implements the Caesar cipher, which is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. The code allows the user to specify the direction (encode or decode), the message to be encrypted or decrypted, and the shift amount. The Caesar cipher function then performs the encryption or decryption based on the provided inputs.
